# Journey-to-Data-Science

Day 1 -- 3rd JAN 2020 : 
I am starting my journey with Github, and learning and mastering Data Science, This repo is more of a way to remind myself to continuously keep improving myself and track my
learning progress. I hope if this small repo can help the budding Data Science enthusiasts in the future and I could be of any little help to them.

Thanks to Krish Naik's Complete Machine Learning playlist on youtube 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe'. 
It's been a few months since I have started to learn on my own with SQL, Excel and Python.

Starting with Python for Data Science, today I had finished all the Python basics. It's kind of like a revision.
