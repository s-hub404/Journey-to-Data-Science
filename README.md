# Journey-to-Data-Science

Day 1 -- 3rd JAN 2020 : 
I am starting my journey with Github, and learning and mastering Data Science, This repo is more of a way to remind myself to continuously keep improving myself and track my
learning progress. I hope if this small repo can help the budding Data Science enthusiasts in the future and I could be of any little help to them.

Thanks to Krish Naik's Complete Machine Learning playlist on youtube 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBTrWtJkn3wWQxZkmTXGwe'. 
It's been a few months since I have started to learn on my own with SQL, Excel and Python.

Starting with Python for Data Science, today I had finished all the Python basics. It's kind of like a revision.

Day 2 -- 4th JAN 2020 :
Continued the commitment, progressed on to learn Python. Got an overview of Python's Data Structure - List, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples, following the video series of Krish Naik's mentioned above.
The aim is to master the basics and get it started with the work. It was relatively easier to quickly grab the concepts, prior knowledge of programming helped.
Python is easy to learn, and its huge Library adds to its effectiveness contributing towards learning Data Science.
